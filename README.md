## üéõÔ∏è What is Loopback for Mac?

**Loopback for Mac** is an advanced virtual audio routing tool developed by Rogue Amoeba, designed to give you complete control over how audio flows on your Mac. Whether you're a **podcaster**, **streamer**, **audio engineer**, or just need to redirect sound between applications, Loopback provides an intuitive interface and professional-grade tools for building custom audio pipelines.

Unlike traditional audio mixers, Loopback lets you create **virtual audio devices** that combine multiple input and output sources ‚Äî such as microphones, apps (like Zoom, Spotify, or Logic), and system audio ‚Äî into a single stream. You can then use this stream in any software that supports audio input, like OBS, Skype, GarageBand, or recording suites.

With support for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** and macOS **Ventura**, **Sonoma**, and newer versions, Loopback is fully optimized for modern Macs. The drag-and-drop interface makes creating complex audio configurations straightforward, even for beginners.

Loopback also integrates perfectly with **Audio Hijack**, allowing you to capture, filter, and output sound with maximum flexibility. It's a must-have tool for any Mac user working seriously with sound.
